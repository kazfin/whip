if you'd like to play this game offline, run the index.html file in a web browser like chrome. if you run it in internet explorer you will be arrested.

if you would like to mod this game and do not already have a code editor, i recommend Notepad++, it's lightweight, intuitive, free, and in fact, it's what i used myself to program this game.
