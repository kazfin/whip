<h1>Cheating</h1>
<p>Let it be known that this game is ridiculously easy to cheese, however I do not recommend it.</p>
<p>I, along with the creators of any mods you may play, have designed the gameplay in a very specific way. Cheating completely destroys this, and that's poo.</p>
<p>This is a singleplayer game. Cheesing it only makes it less fun for you. Only sad, lonely, nerds (not including people who need to test the code) cheat at Bad Life Simulator.</p>
<p>If you do want a (relatively) free experience, there's always sandbox mode to play around in.</p><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><button class="hand-cursor">OK</button><br><br>
<button class="hand-cursor">Stop showing me this, I'm not cheating</button></div>
<p>These buttons don't work</p>
