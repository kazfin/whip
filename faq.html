<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">Please note that the following fixes are for the vanilla, modless version of Bad Life Simulator only. In some cases, certain mods can introduce new bugs that may not be accounted for here.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why am I seeing "Get a browser that was made past the year 1997"?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">If you're seeing this error, it means JavaScript is not enabled on your browser. BLS requires JavaScript to function. To fix this, go into your browser's settings, search "javascript", click enable, and then refresh the page.<br><br>If it's already enabled, refresh the page. If this still doesn't work, BLS may be blacklisted from using javascript. To fix this, click the button to the left of the website's URL, then click "site settings". Then, scroll down to JavaScript, click the dropdown box, and then click "allow".<br><br>If JavaScript still doesn't work, or you can't find these options, your browser may not support JavaScript at all. In this case, please try a different browser.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why has all my save data dissapeared?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Your save data can be deleted if you delete your browser's cache. Unfortunately, there is no way to recover this lost data. If you recently switched browsers, you can try and transfer the data between your old browser and new browser.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why am I getting stuck on the "You will be redirected automatically" screen?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">If you're playing on the website, check your internet connection. If you're sure you're connected, try to run a speed test. If you're playing offline, this is a bug. Please report it in the #bug-reports channel of our <a href="https://discord.gg/DPGZ26BKTA" target="_blank">discord server</a> with details including what you did to get stuck, what you were trying to do, as well as any other details you deem important. If you've used the console to change any variables, this is a horror of your own creation. If you're playing on a mod, try to contact its creator(s) about the issue.</p>
